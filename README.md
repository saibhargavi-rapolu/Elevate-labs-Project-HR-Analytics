HR Analytics â€“ Employee Attrition Analysis & Dashboard

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition patterns using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset.  
It combines Python for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling with Power BI for interactive business storytelling.

The goal is to help HR teams identify key drivers of attrition and take proactive measures to improve employee retention

Objectives
- Clean and preprocess HR data for analysis
- Explore patterns and correlations influencing attrition
- Build a predictive model to estimate attrition likelihood
- Visualize insights in an interactive Power BI dashboard
- Provide actionable recommendations for HR decision-making

- Tools & Technologies
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, SHAP
- Power BI: DAX, interactive visuals, Smart Narrative
- GitHub for version control and project sharing

- Steps Taken
1. Data Cleaning: Removed irrelevant columns, encoded categorical variables, created Age Groups
2. EDA: Visualized attrition trends by department, overtime, salary, and age
3. Modeling: Logistic Regression for interpretability
4. Explainability: SHAP values to identify top predictors
5. Export: Saved cleaned dataset for Power BI
6. Dashboard: Designed interactive visuals and KPIs
7. Reporting: Summarized findings in a PDF report
